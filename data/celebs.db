I don&#x27;t have any other such places.<p>Also, HN was drowned out for the first week or so. Then it became a steady trickle. Then a bunch of people, presumably such as yourself, decided that even that trickle was irritating to them and started flagging NSA stories on sight. Since then the trickle has died out, and there is nothing.<p>Obama and his cohorts can go back to bed in peace, knowing this was just another internet fad and, as predicted, the geeks are easily distracted by some new gadgets or talk of technical gimmicks.</span></html></div><div>by swombat | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6458513\">link</a><!DOCTYPE html>\n<html> | on: <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6458258\">NSA chief sidesteps queries on cellphone location tracking</a><br><span class=\"comment\">For the record, I am saddened to see that HN has given up on giving stories about this their proper place. There haven&#x27;t been many stories on the topic rising to the top recently, and the few who did sank back down quickly, presumably under the weight of flaggings by people who&#x27;d rather read about Erlang or web design or funding topics or startup stories or obscure technological marvels or some other worthy topic (not sarcastic - I think those are fine topics to read about).<p>It is sad to see that in the end, distraction wins. Huxley was right - the world is going to turn bad before our eyes but we (as a civilisation) won&#x27;t care, it&#x27;s more fun to just read about what we like. We&#x27;re just too good at producing stuff that we like to read, and at ignoring stuff that&#x27;s uncomfortable.<p>Until this is resolved in some way, there should not be a day that passes without one of the top HN stories being about NSA spying.</span></html></div></html>", "grellas" "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html></html>", "pg" "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html><div>by pg | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6462933\">link</a><!DOCTYPE html>\n<html> | submitted: <a href=\"http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/09/walter-isaacson-on-bill-gates-at-harvard#.UkcLBWZGWrs.twitter\">Walter Isaacson on Bill Gates at Harvard</a><br><br></html></div><div>by pg | <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6449235\">link</a><!DOCTYPE html>\n<html> | submitted: <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-26/fossil-discovery-links-gap-in-evolutionary-knowledge-of-fish/4981652\">419-million-year-old fish fossil resolves 'missing link' in evolution</a><br><br></html></div></html>"}
