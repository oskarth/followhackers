The real insight is that the free product has a chance to reach an enormous audience which provides distribution&#x2F;advertising&#x2F;marketing making it trivial to go to market with your paid product.<p>What Marco is reporting here is that the old-fashioned &quot;make something and get people to pay for it&quot; business is much harder to pull off and likely to always be left in the dust by someone making the same thing for free, getting 100x the user base, and getting 1% of them to pay for some value added feature.</span></html></p></div></html>"}
